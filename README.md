# Virga

Virga is a minimum Eleventy starter kit for those who love to customize for your own needs. It is based on Hylia Starter Kit created by Andy Bell.
And I'm also using it as my blog about Eleventy.

You can fork this repo and get started now by [deploying Virga to Netlify][deploy-to-netlify]

## NOTE

- When you fork this repo, make sure replace or remove `paymentPointer` in `src/_data/site.json`. I have explained why and how on [Money Blues](https://virga.frontendweekly.tokyo/posts/2020-03-28-money-blues/).
